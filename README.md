There are slides at [https://mjgreen.github.io/coding-psychopy-2024/slides.html](https://mjgreen.github.io/coding-psychopy-2024/slides.html).

Requests:

* In previous work I have needed advanced randomisation, branching based off previous responses, and pulling previous responses and presenting them to the participant.
* To assess different components of executive functions, I will use a set of neuropsychological tests including the delay recognition task, stop signal test, digit span test, trail making test, and Wisconsin card sorting test, all administered using PsychoPy.
