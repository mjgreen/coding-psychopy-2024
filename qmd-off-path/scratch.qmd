# How to compute an accuracy rate for a block and use it for thresholding

---
  
  * Start with an empty list
* Per-trial add to the list 0 or 1 based on key_resp.corr or some explicit calculation of accuracy
* At end of block calculate the mean of the list for an accuracy rate
* say, `if rate better than 80% then end the practice block and continue to the experimental block`
```{python}
#| eval: false
if rate>.8:
  trials.finished = True
```
